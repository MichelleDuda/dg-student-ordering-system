## User Story Testing

### Site Owner Goals
1. The use of Bootsrap and Custom CSS along with vibrant colorful images of food deliver a visually appealing site. 
2. The navbar creates an easily navigable site. The use of colorful buttons throughout the pages helps to draw the user's attention to the important navigation links. 
3. The selling points section of the homepage, along with the simple yet infomrative about page give parents adequate information. Pricing information and sample menus are easily accessible via the button overlaying the hero image on the homepage. 

### User Goals
As a First-Time user I want to:
1. I am easily to understand the purpose of this site as the homepage displays a clear image of food with an informative text overlay. The short description of the catering companies services below the hero image further helps me to understand what the company does.
2. I am able to quickly  view relavant information, including price and sample menu because of the button overlaying the hero image on the homepage. 
3. I am able to easily register for an account via the Register link in the navbar. 

As a Returning User I want to:
1. I am able=to quickly log in via the Log In link on the navbar.
2. I am easily able to place/update my orders, as the site redirects me to my Student Dashboard upon sign in. Here I can place a new order, view & update past orders, update my profile information, and provide feedback to the company.
3. I am able to easily view my previous orders via the View Past Orders button in my Student Dashboard
4. I am able to submit a new order easily via the Place Order button on my Student Dashboard. I am able to see that it submitted successfully via a banner that appears at the top of the page when I am redirected to my Orders page after submitting my order. On this page I can also view my order and the details of that order, including the order date. 

### Kanban Board - USER STORY Testing
1. UX for Potential Users - A company logo and navigation bar as visible when the user first logs in, creating a easily navigable page. The user is easily able to tell the purpose of the site via the hero image and text overlay (which includes a breif description of the service). The text overlay also contains a button that links to the about page for ease of access to sample menus and pricing. 
2. Account Registration - A user is able to easily register for the site via the Register link in the navigation bar. The user is logged in after Registration and redirected to the Student Dashboard where they can easily place orders, view orders, update/delete orders, as well as perform other functions.
3. View Past Orders - If a user is authenticated they have access to the Student Dashboard - which contains a link to the Past Orders Page. This page allows users to view orders they have placed, expand order details, and udpate/delete the order if it isn't already in progress or closed. 
4. ADMIN: Update Menu - When logged into a staff or superuser account an additional navigation link appears to create menus. This gives admin users a user friendly way to enter menus without having to utilize the Django admin panel. The Django admin panel is also udpated with filters, searches, and categorized display lists to allow for easy interaction for admins. 
5. Student Dashboard - Users are redirected to a Student Dashboard after log in for quick easy access to important pages. The Student Dashboard is only accessible to authenticated users and the link only appears in the navigation bar if a user is authenticated. This dashboard contains links to place an order, view past orders (where users can then update or delete open orders), update their profile information, and provide feedback to the company regarding their meals. 
6. Place an Order - When a user is authenticated they can easily access the following week's menu to place an order, via the Place Order button in the Student Dashboard.
7. Update Menu Selections - Authenticated users have the ability to update their menu choices after placing an order for the following menu week. The menu view is set to pre-populate a user's selections in the menu page, if they have already made selections for a user friendly update experience.
8. View Sample Menu - The sample menu is included on the About page which is accessible to unathenticated site visitors.
9. Delete Order - Authenticated users are able to delete open orders, via the Past Orders page of their Student Dashboard. The delete button is programmed to only appear for orders that are considered open (when the start date of the menu week in the future) in order to prevent student's from deleting historical data for meals that have already been processed. 
10. Update User Account Information - Authenticated users are able to update their first name, last name, email address, & password via the Update Profile button in the Student Dashboard. The form makes sure to reload the users session after a password update to ensure they remain authenticated until they sign out.
